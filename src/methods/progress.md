### Focused Altars:

The altars listed below are those I am currently focusing on.

It should be noted that for all methods below (excluding the Abyss), a tiara will need to be used.

 ### What about Abyss runecrafting & pouches?
 
 Once the above tasks have been completed, Abyss will be the next process to tackle.
 The Abyss will be a single, but greater task, compared to those listed above.
 It will have to take into account the risk for being killed by other players as well as creatures within the abyss.
 Banking will be done through clan wars to replenish run energy as well as remove the skull obtained through the use of the Abyss.
 
 
 Within the Abyss, a `TreeTask` will determine whether repairing of pouches is required.
 If so, when it is near the Dark mage, it will repair them through him.
 
 Pouch usage outside of the Abyss will only be permitted if configured to the Lunar spellbook.
 This will allow for NPC Contact to be cast - contacting the Abyss' Dark mage to fix them on the spot.
